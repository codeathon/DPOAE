Project DPOAE (Distortion Product Otto-Acoustic Emmision) System

Please refer to the Python installation guide for details on setting
up Python and the the necessary library imports.
The document is titled 
DPOAE_System_Setup

The Software:
It needs to be modular. Hence after a thorough Requirement Gathering,
the MVC (Model, View, Controller) framework was chosen.

Package 'model':
	The database used here is MySQL.
	Contains an '_init_.py' which contains all the API's to enable communication
	with the database.
	For adding any more API's to enhance communication with the Database,
	put the functions here.


Package 'view'
	This package contains the Front End (GUI - Graphical User Interface)
	The GUI has been built using 'Tkinter'. 
	All the GUI classes are in the '_init_.py' file of this package.
	
Package 'controller'
	This package contains the code responsible for the controller.
	This is invoked to direct the function calls to the respective view and model API's.
	This can be exploited much better than what it currently is.

All the code files are very well commented.

Future work:
The Experiment Maker and the Schedule Maker have been set up and work fine.
These could be fine tuned based on some changes expected out of the software.
